AI Microservices with Flowise
This repository contains a collection of AI-powered microservices built using Flowise, a low-code/no-code tool for building Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Each project is designed as a modular API that can be easily integrated into other applications.

üåü About The Project
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to rapidly develop and deploy powerful AI microservices using a visual development environment. By leveraging Flowise, we can create complex LLM chains and expose them as robust REST APIs without writing extensive code.

This repository provides the exported JSON chatflows for three distinct services.

‚ú® Features
üìù Text Summarization API: Takes a long piece of text and returns a concise summary.

üìö Q&A Over Documents API: Allows you to "chat" with your documents by answering questions based on their content (RAG).

üó∫Ô∏è Dynamic Learning Path Suggestion API: Generates a custom, step-by-step learning plan based on a user's goals and current skill level.

üõ†Ô∏è Built With
Flowise: The low-code platform for building LLM apps.

LangChain: The underlying framework that powers Flowise's components.

Ollama: For serving open-source LLMs (like Llama 3 or Mistral) locally.

üöÄ Getting Started
To get these microservices up and running, you'll need to have Flowise and a local LLM server installed.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Flowise runs on Node.js. Install version 18 or higher.

Flowise: Install Flowise globally via npm.

Bash

npm install -g flowise
Ollama: Install Ollama to serve your open-source LLM. After installation, pull a model.

Bash

ollama run llama3:8b-instruct
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Start Flowise:

Bash

npx flowise start
This will launch the Flowise UI, typically at http://localhost:3000.

Import the Chatflows:

In the Flowise UI, click "Add New".

Choose "Import Chatflow" and select one of the .json files from this repository (e.g., text-summarizer.json).

The chatflow will load onto the canvas. Ensure your Ollama LLM nodes are correctly configured to point to your local model.

Save the chatflow. Repeat for the other two .json files.

üí° Usage & API Endpoints
Once a chatflow is saved in Flowise, you can access its API endpoint by clicking the "API Endpoint" button in the top-right corner.

Note: You will need to replace YOUR_CHATFLOW_ID in the example URLs with the actual ID from your Flowise instance.

1. Text Summarization API
This endpoint takes a block of text and returns a summary.

Endpoint: POST /api/v1/predict/YOUR_CHATFLOW_ID

Request Body:

JSON

{
  "question": "Your long text to be summarized goes here..."
}
cURL Example:

Bash

curl -X POST \
  --location "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/predict/YOUR_CHATFLOW_ID" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-raw '{
    "question": "Flowise is a low-code tool for developers to build customized LLM apps. LangChain is an open-source framework that allows developers to combine LLMs with other sources of computation or knowledge. Flowise is built on top of LangChain.js."
  }'
Example Response:

JSON

{
  "text": "Flowise is a user-friendly, low-code tool built on the LangChain framework that enables developers to create custom applications powered by Large Language Models."
}
2. Q&A Over Documents API
This endpoint answers questions based on a document you have already uploaded and processed within the chatflow.

Note: The initial document upload and vectorization happens within the Flowise UI. The API is used for querying after the knowledge base is established.

Endpoint: POST /api/v1/predict/YOUR_CHATFLOW_ID

Request Body:

JSON

{
  "question": "What is the main topic of the document?"
}
cURL Example:

Bash

curl -X POST \
  --location "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/predict/YOUR_CHATFLOW_ID" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-raw '{
    "question": "What are the core components of the Flowise architecture?"
  }'
Example Response:

JSON

{
  "text": "Based on the document, the core components of the Flowise architecture include nodes, chains, and agents, all orchestrated through a visual canvas."
}
3. Dynamic Learning Path Suggestion API
This endpoint requires multiple inputs to generate a personalized learning plan. The input variable names (topic, skill_level, goal) must match those defined in your chatflow's prompt template.

Endpoint: POST /api/v1/predict/YOUR_CHATFLOW_ID

Request Body:

JSON

{
  "question": "unused",
  "overrideConfig": {
    "topic": "Python for Data Science",
    "skill_level": "Beginner with some programming knowledge",
    "goal": "Build a machine learning model to predict house prices"
  }
}
cURL Example:

Bash

curl -X POST \
  --location "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/predict/YOUR_CHATFLOW_ID" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-raw '{
    "question": "unused",
    "overrideConfig": {
      "topic": "Python for Data Science",
      "skill_level": "Beginner with some programming knowledge",
      "goal": "Build a machine learning model to predict house prices"
    }
  }'
Example Response:

JSON

{
  "text": "### Module 1: Python & NumPy Fundamentals\n- **Concepts:** Variables, data types, loops, functions, NumPy arrays, array manipulation.\n- **Project:** Create a simple command-line calculator.\n\n### Module 2: Data Analysis with Pandas\n- **Concepts:** DataFrames, Series, reading CSV files, data cleaning, filtering, and grouping.\n- **Project:** Analyze a public dataset (e.g., Titanic) to find key insights."
